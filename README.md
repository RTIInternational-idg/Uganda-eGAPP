# Uganda-eGAPP
The Governance, Accountability, Participation and Performance (GAPP) Programme, funded by the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) in Uganda is a continuation of the first GAPP Program that was previously jointly funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and DFID. The proposed activities will build upon the activities and results achieved under that programme and, to extent possible, the recommendations from the final performance evaluation concluded in November 2019. Implementation will be in 15 districts  and 5 municipalities.
